                <p>
                    My "other" database I want to create will be called Bike. The Bike database will hold 
                    information about a users bike. Allowing for users to post information about their Bike
                    as well as view other user's bikes.

                <h3>My Database Experience</h3>

                    I have no database experience
                </p>
                <h3>My Web Development Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I have some web dev experience but only front-end design. 
                    I'm familar with html and css as well js and react.

                <p>
                    The things I found easy about this first homework assignment include the css and html tasks. 
                    The things I found difficult about this first assignment include using Media query and 
                    creating my database structure. As I have never worked on databases, I found it challenging to 
                    visualize my "other" database at first. The thing I found most valuable about this assignment 
                    was the visualization of our database. I had to do some research in order to fully understand 
                    the task and so now I have a slightly better understanding of databases.
                </p>
                <h3>Database</h3>
                <p>
                    I don't have any database experience. Honestly, the biggest thing I feared about web development 
                    was backend.

                    The part I found hardest about homework 2 was getting the correct filtered table up on MySQL. Everything 
                    else was pretty straight forward and I was able to follow a similar process to the database lab which 
                    helped make this homework assignment much easier.
